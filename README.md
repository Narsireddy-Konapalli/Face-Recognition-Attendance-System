# Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is a **Face Recognition Attendance System** built with Python. It uses Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface, captures images from a camera, registers faces, and maintains attendance records in a database. The system allows users to check attendance and is designed for easy deployment and use.

## Features

- **Face Registration**: Capture and register user faces using a camera.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognize and authenticate registered faces.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Record attendance of recognized users and store data in a database.
- **Attendance Check**: Users can view their attendance records.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides an interactive web interface for users.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **OpenCV**: For capturing and processing images.
- **Face Recognition Library**: Used for detecting and recognizing faces.
- **Streamlit**: For building a web-based user interface.
- **SQLite**: For storing attendance records.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-attendance-system.git
   cd face-recognition-attendance-system
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python face-recognition streamlit
   
3. **Run the Application:**

   After cloning the repository and installing all the necessary libraries, run the following command to start the Streamlit app:
   ``` bash
   streamlit run main.py

### Registration Using Camera

After entering your name and USN, the camera will open and monitor your face for 60 frames. Once your face is detected continuously for 59 frames, the application will capture the image and display a confirmation message indicating successful registration.

### Marking Attendance

To mark attendance, select the subject from the dropdown menu. Once the subject is selected, enter your USN in the provided field. After entering the information, click the "submit" button. The application will use your registered face to verify your identity and log your attendance accordingly.

 **Screenshot Example**: Below is a screenshot of the attendance marking page, showing the dropdown menu for subject selection and the USN entry field.
